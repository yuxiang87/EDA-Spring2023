This exercise accompanies the introductory material in Environmental Data Analytics.

## Directions

1.  Rename this file `<FirstLast>_A01_Introduction.Rmd` (replacing `<FirstLast>` with your first and last name).
2.  Change "Student Name" on line 3 (above) with your name.
3.  Work through the steps, **creating code and output** that fulfill each instruction.
4.  Be sure to **answer the questions** in this assignment document.
5.  When you have completed the assignment, **Knit** the text and code into a single PDF file.
6.  After Knitting, submit the completed exercise (PDF file) to the appropriate assigment section on Sakai.

## 1) Finish setting up R Studio

### Install TinyTex

Now, run this code cell the same way. This will install "tinytex" -- a helper app that allows you to knit your markdown documents into professional quality PDFs.

```{r install tiny tex, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
#install tinytext
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

### Set your default knit directory

This setting will help deal with relative paths later on... - From the Tool menu, select `Global Options` - Select the RMarkdown section - In the "Evaluate chunks in directory", set the option to "Project"

## 2) Discussion Questions

Enter answers to the questions just below the \>Answer: prompt.

1.  What are your previous experiences with data analytics, R, and Git? Include both formal and informal training.

> Answer: I am a student from the international Master of Environmental Policy (iMEP) program, and I used R through course PUBPOL870K last spring. We learned some statistics knowledge through R, such as frequency, sampling, regression, etc.

2.  Are there any components of the course about which you feel confident?

> Answer: I know some statistical logic that might help me understand the R coding process.

3.  Are there any components of the course about which you feel apprehensive?

> Answer: The previous bad experience with R was caused by the operating system is Mac. After reading and following the web guides, i have successfully installed all the necessary soft ware, so this might no longer be a problem.

## 3) GitHub

Provide a link below to your forked course repository in GitHub. Make sure you have pulled all recent changes from the course repository and that you have updated your course README file, committed those changes, and pushed them to your GitHub account.
